# MBOX Sorter

MBOX Sorter is a Java application that can be used to sort the emails stored in a MBOX file by Date in descending order, where the Date is extracted from the email 'From' line metadata.

## MBOX Sorter Goals
* Storing the emails from the MBOX file specified by the user in temporary files for sorting.
* Replacing the MBOX file specified by the user with the result of sorting the emails.
* Showing a progress bar with the percentage of completion of the task.
* Allowing to sort a MBOX file without user interaction through pass the file path as argument of the application.

## Usage
The application can be used with or without user interaction. If the application is runned without arguments the MBOX file to sort will be asked to the user in the console.

For interactive mode run:

`java -jar MboxSorter.jar`

For non interactive mode you can use the arguments, passing the path of the MBOX file:

`java -jar MboxSorter.jar D:\MyMboxFile.mbox`

## Note
Several MBOX's formats exist, and in although the program only needs the 'From' metadata of the email, which must be stored in one line and must contains a valid date, the program only has been tested with the MBOX files generated by Gmail's backups. Bear in mind that the program replaces the MBOX file, make out a backup copy of the file if you consider him convenient.
