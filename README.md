# MBOX Sorter

MBOX Sorter is a Java application that can be used to sort the emails stored in a [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file by Date in descending order, where the Date is extracted from the email 'From' line metadata.

## MBOX Sorter Goals
* Storing the emails from the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file specified by the user in temporary files for sorting.
* Replacing the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file specified by the user with the result of sorting the emails.
* Showing a progress bar with the percentage of completion of the task.
* Allowing to sort a [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file without user interaction through pass the file path as argument of the application.

## Usage
The application can be used with or without user interaction. If the application is runned without arguments the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file to sort will be asked to the user in the console.

For interactive mode run:

`java -jar MboxSorter.jar`

For non interactive mode you can use the arguments, passing the path of the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file:

`java -jar MboxSorter.jar D:\MyMboxFile.mbox`

## Note
Several [MBOX's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) formats exist, and in although the program only needs the 'From' metadata of the email, which must be stored in one line and must contains a valid date, the program only has been tested with the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) files generated by Gmail's backups. Bear in mind that the program replaces the [MBOX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox) file, make out a backup copy of the file if you consider him convenient.
